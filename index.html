    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; max-width: 800px;">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">I am a fifth-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, working in the <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/ioms-dept/">Department of Technology, Operations, and Statistics (TOPS)</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/arun-sundararajan">Arun Sundararajan</a>. My <a href="https://rubingli123.github.io/research/">research</a> is grounded in economics and statistics with a heavy dose of AI and machine learning. I have worked on questions relating to marketplace design and information transparency in two-sided digital platforms, on sustainable consumption enabled by digital platforms, on natural language processing, and on trust in generative AI. I also apply design principles to develop systems and frameworks that enhance data-driven decision-making in retail. I am well-versed in and have used a range of methods including econometrics, applied machine learning, structural IO models, randomized experiments and game theory.</p> When I’m not doing research, I am an avid reader of fiction and enjoy exploring various outdoor sports, including snowboarding, mountain climbing, and <a href="https://rubingli123.github.io/misc/">occasionally</a> marathon running.
